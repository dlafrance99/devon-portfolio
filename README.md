# Devon LaFrance Portfolio
Welcome to my Portfolio! This application shows some of the skills I've acquired through my bootcamp as well as my own learning. The point of this application, is to give a basic introduction to me, and enable users to understand my style and my skills. There are three main pages, About Me, Portfolio, and a Contact me section.
